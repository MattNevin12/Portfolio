Hey all!

I have spent the better part of this year getting my Unity Development career back to "industry standard." After welcoming 2 kids into the world  over the last 3 years and, dare I say, a little complacancy with the state of my portfolio, It's time I clean up the unmanaged storage shed of a repository.

That said, my old portfolio repository was a mess! I am currently working to restore my portfolio with working builds. If there is anything you are hoping to find but can't, please reach out to me and I will get it to you as quickly as possible!

I've enjoyed jumping into new projects and building out yet another "million dollar game idea," but it is also on my portfolio road map to refurbish some of these old projects. Please stop back in from time to time to check out new progress!

Cheers!
